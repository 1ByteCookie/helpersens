# HelperSens
Some console application that will figure out the adjusted sensitivity when changing the mouse DPI, (Results are personalized for myself based on my eDPI per game)

## Remarks
I think I've spent a few minutes automating a task that should only take a few seconds. Also, I don't think this is how you properly make a console application. It's for personal use so I guess it's all good ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
